							<p>Every conscious being has interests that should be respected. No being who is conscious of being alive should be devalued to thinghood, dominated, used as a resource or a commodity. The crux of the idea known as animal rights is a movement to extend moral consideration to all conscious beings.

							Nobody should have to demonstrate a specific level of intelligence to be accorded moral consideration. No one should have to be judged beautiful to be accorded moral consideration. No being should have to be useful to humanity or capable of accepting "duties" in order to be extended moral consideration. Indeed, what other animals need from us is being free from duties to us.</p>

							Under the big top, animals perform through various forms of coercion. No free-living animal performs such choreographed stunts for human onlookers naturally. From tigers jumping through flaming hoops to elephants dressed up like Vegas dancers, animals caught or purposely bred for circuses live highly unnatural scenarios rather than the lives of freedom they ought to be leading. Some circuses greenwash what they do by claiming to breed endangered species. Generally, they ignore the key point of animal rights: Life matters but freedom matters just as much.
 
							Many communities have acknowledged that circuses treat nonhuman animals unjustly, and refuse to welcome circus acts with animals. If you live in such a community and a circus comes to town, check to see whether this circus normally performs with animals or not. Even if the circus removes its animal acts to adhere to your municipality’s by-laws, ticket-holders will still be supporting a circus that has no problem with using animals when the by-laws do not prohibit it.

							On a positive note, an increasing number of companies refuse to use animals and these companies merit our support. Also, young people can be offered opportunities to see human performers, or learn to perform themselves. Music, dance, puppet shows, juggling, kite-making, photography -- all these activities teach us a talent and we enjoy them as well. Serious educators: Think about the value of these ideas rather than helping a circus corporation make money by herding young people into seats so they can watch animals being dominated and controlled.

							Why Should New Yorkers Support A Ban of Horse-Drawn Carriages?

							Friends of Animals is committed to enacting legislation to ban horse-drawn carriages in New York City and to obtaining sanctuary for the over 200 horses enslaved within this industry. We work closely with legislators, and facilitate rallies, media events, press conferences, and public education to make this a reality.

							Historic New York State legislation was introduced, in the Spring of 2011, into the New York Senate and Assembly to ban horse-drawn carriages in NYC. Friends of Animals is pressing to pass this ban bill on the state level. Our international efforts extend to ending the use of horse-drawn vehicles in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Victoria, Canada, and other cities as well. Why?

							1. Exploitative Industry

							In order to generate a profit and provide short-term entertainment for tourists, the horses are forced to work on hard pavement in dangerous, unhealthful and unnatural conditions, in all manner of extreme weather, confined between carriage shafts and then inadequate warehouse stalls. This is an inherent injustice to horses, who evolved as social (herd) animals, and who are naturally meant to socialize with other animals and run free. An existence as a carriage horse necessarily means one that is psychologically and physically unhealthy for a horse.

							Horses are sometimes sent to the “killer buyer” auctions when they can no longer make a profit for their owners. Horse meat is consumed in other countries, and used-up horses are at risk of being trucked from the United States to Canada and Mexico to slaughterhouses when they are no longer deemed valuable to their owners.

							Although an estimated 100 million cats and dogs live in homes in the United States at a given time, many face the dangers associated with abandonment. U.S. animal shelters kill millions of relinquished dogs and cats each year. Uncounted millions more cats and dogs suffer illness, exposure, poisoning, starvation, and lonely deaths in vacant lots, under the buildings of cities and towns, on interstate highways and on country roads.

							From our beginning in 1957, Friends of Animals has assumed a leadership role in advocating low-cost spaying and neutering as the most effective means of preventing the births of domestic dogs and cats and indirectly sparing many animals from grim fates in shelters. For five decades, we have operated the leading coast-to-coast cat and dog neutering initiative in the United States. This unique system, powered by a membership of 700 veterinarians located in 34 states and Puerto Rico, helps people obtain affordable procedures for more than 40,000 animals each year. Our educational efforts have drawn thousands of calls each month to our toll-free spay/neuter information line.

							In this feature, we ask veterinarians who have made a difference in professional attitudes about domestic animals for the scoop on veterinary education, the business of medical treatment for pets, and the outlook for future trends in veterinary care in the public service.

							Two students, Gloria Binkowski and Eric K. Dunayer, were pioneers: two of the first people in the United States to refuse to vivisect and still obtain their veterinary degrees. Their message? Never doubt that individuals can make a difference. Dr. Eric Dunayer, now a consulting veterinarian in clinical toxicology in Illinois, communicated with Friends of Animals electronically. FoA caught up with Dr. Gloria Binkowski during a typically busy workday at a New York animal hospital offering holistic veterinary therapies.

							In a November 2008 landmark agreement with the Gambian government, the international animal-rights organization Friends of Animals agreed to help fund and support the Chimpanzee Rehabilitation Project, an island sanctuary located in the River Gambia National Park. It is home to some 99 chimpanzees, who live in relative freedom—without bars or cages—on three of the national park’s five islands. ECOTOURISM : Baboon Island Travel Brochure – see chimpanzees in their natural habitat.
 
							Primatologist Janis Carter, who has worked with the national park’s chimpanzees for three decades, has been appointed the director, and will maintain the 1,500-acre, open-air sanctuary, while also working to protect the region’s habitat, provide local environmental education, and foster community development.

							Many of the refuge’s chimpanzees were confiscated as orphans of parents killed by hunters for bushmeat or for zoos, the entertainment industry, or other forms of exploitation. Some were voluntarily relinquished by people who had unwisely tried to make them into pets.
 
							Capturing young chimpanzees requires the killing of the mother and often other family members. Killing female chimpanzees with nursing infants reaps double gains for the hunter. The body of the mother is dried and sold for meat while the orphans are put on the commercial market. Only one orphan in ten survives the ordeal of transport.
							 
							But the chimpanzees in the Chimpanzee Rehabilitation Project now enjoy the national park’s gallery forest, woodlands, and swamp savannahs. The islands are also in the habitat of manatees, hippos, and highly endangered red colobus monkeys.
							 
							Friends of Animals’ support is crucial as it will ensure that the chimpanzees receive supplemental food for a complete diet and to prevent overstripping of the island vegetation by the chimpanzees. FoA will also ensure the health monitoring that is vital to the survival of these great apes.  Make a donation to the Chimpanzee Rehabilitation Project.
							 
							The Chimpanzee Rehabilitation Project established an environmental education program in the late 1980s to promote the survival of the chimpanzees and their habitat among local residents, and that initiative will continue under Friends of Animals’ partnership. The educational initiative has received financial support from the Netherlands Ecosystem Grant Program of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which will continue to provide the major portion of the funding for the next two and a half years.
							 
							Local schoolchildren take part in environmental education classes conducted by the CRP’s team of local instructors. Adult outreach is carried on through meetings that concentrate on local environmental issues. An education center will open in December.
							 
							Ecological conservation combined with employment for local people is important. So is the privacy of the island chimpanzees.
							 
							Tourism will be kept unobtrusive. While visitors in a boat might chance to view a curious chimpanzee at the edge of the islands, the emphasis is on respect for animals’ own ways of being, with activities such as birdwatching, hiking and cultural tours. A percentage of funds raised through tourism will be allocated to development and infrastructural projects for local villages in the vicinity of River Gambia National Park.
							 
							For three decades, this unique project has protected chimpanzees and their tranquil island homes. Recognized as the longest running rehabilitation project for chimpanzees, the Chimpanzee Rehabilitation Project is an inspiration to 20 other refuges throughout Africa. The future of the villagers is connected with the future of the chimpanzees, and the health of the land and waters. FoA is committed to a secure future for all.

							Hunting in all forms is unethical, socially unjustifiable and ecologically disruptive. A sound environmental ethic benefits us all, and fosters respect and protection for free-living animals. From Canadian seal pups to monk parakeets nesting along the Connecticut shore to the wolves of Alaska, their rights to life and safety must be ensured.

							Hunting --  a deceitful and unnecessary act done by humans for purely gratuitous reasons
							Bears -- face imminent threats by hunters and wildlife agencies around the country
							Coyotes--
							Deer -- constantly subjected to cruel population management techniques, such as shooting and birth control
							Foxes--targeted by the cruel fur industry and subjected to hunting.
							Monk Parakeets -- considered by some to be an “invasive species” and subjected to many government eradication efforts
							Mute Swans -- the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, without meaningful environmental impact studies on these beautiful birds, actively attempts to annihilate their populations 
							Oryx -- even though an endangered species, Oryx are being shot on US hunting ranches
							Seals -- for decades Canada’s annual seal hunt results in the death of hundreds of thousands of harp and grey seals, all for the sale of their pelts
							Tundra Swans -- keep these swans fully protected from being hunted
							Wolves -- unfairly and unjustly vilified and persecuted by government agencies, ranchers, and hunters for decades, the killing of these ecologically vital and intelligent creatures should not be tolerated
